Mergify offers a comprehensive RESTful API that facilitates seamless
integration. This API provides access to data and functionalities that can
enhance your Mergify experience.

## API Endpoint

All API requests should be directed to: `https://api.mergify.com/v1/`

The API is entirely documented in the [API reference](/api).

</Button>

## Authentication

### Creating an Application Key

To start with the API, you'll first need to create an application associated
with your organization:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com).
2. Proceed to create an Application.

<Image src={applicationKeysCreate} alt="Create application keys"/>

Upon successful creation, the dashboard will provide you with an API key.

<Image src={applicationKeysToken} alt="Application key token"/>

### Using the API Key

With the provided API key, you're set to make authenticated requests against
the Mergify API. For example, to validate the authenticity of your token, you
can retrieve your application's information:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <my-application-api-key>" https://api.mergify.com/v1/application
```

Response:
```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "my application",
    "github_account": {
        "id": 123,
        "login": "Mergify",
        "type": "Organization",
    }
}
```

### Revoking an Application Key

If, for any reason, you need to revoke an application key:

1. Head to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com).
2. Simply delete the corresponding application.

<Image src={applicationKeysDelete} alt="Delete application key"/>

By doing so, the application and its key will be removed, revoking any access
provided by that key.

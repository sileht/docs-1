The Mergify configuration file is an essential component of using our platform
effectively. This document will provide a comprehensive overview of the file,
including its name, format, and the data structure schema.

## Configuration File Name

Mergify applies the following rule to find and use its configuration:

- It reads the file named `.mergify.yml`, or, as a fallback,
  `.mergify/config.yml` or `.github/mergify.yml` from the repository root
  directory.

- It reads the file from the default repository branch configured on GitHub â€”
  usually `main`.

- It can extends the configuration by another configuration using the keyword
  `extends` â€” see ["extending the configuration
  file"](file-format#extending-configuration-files).

## File Format

The configuration file uses the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format, which is both
human-readable and machine-parsable. YAML is easy to read and edit, making it a
popular choice for configuration files.

The file main type is a dictionary and each key of the dictionary configures a
different aspect of Mergify:

{/* FIXME: add link to a better page than writing your first rule? */}

- [`pull_request_rules`](#pull-request-rules) configures [Automation
  Workflow](/workflow/);

- [`queue_rules`](#queue-rules) configures the [Merge
  Queue](/merge-queue);

- [`partition_rules`](#partition-rules) configures [monorepository support in
  the merge queue](/merge-queue/partitions);

- [`commands_restrictions`](/commands/restrictions) configures who is able to
  run commands;

- [`defaults`](#defaults) allows to configure default options for various
  actions;

- [`shared`](#shared) allows to [define any YAML payload that can be used using
  YAML anchors](sharing#sharing-configuration-sections);

- [`extends`](#extends) allows to [extend the
  configuration](sharing#extending-configuration-files) file by importing
  another configuration file.

### Pull Request Rules

The top-level key `pull_request_rules` allows to automate your workflow by
writing rules that execute actions. It must be a list of dictionary with the
following keys:

<OptionsTable name="PullRequestRule" />

Example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: add label when author is jd
    conditions:
      - author = jd
    actions:
      label:
        add:
          - jd
```

### Queue Rules

The top-level key `queue_rules` allows to define the rules that reign over your
[merge queues](/merge-queue).

<OptionsTable name="QueueRule" />

### Partition Rules

The top-level key `partition_rules` allows to split your repositories into
independent partitions. This is especially useful when using a [monorepo with
the merge queue](/merge-queue/partitions).

<OptionsTable name="PartitionRule" />

### Defaults

The `defaults` section provides a means to set configuration values that act as
fallbacks for actions executed by both [pull request rules](/workflow/) and
[commands](/commands). Instead of defining the same options repeatedly for
different rules, you can specify them once in the defaults section. If a
particular option is directly defined under `pull_request_rules`, it will take
precedence; otherwise, the system resorts to the values defined in defaults.

```yaml
defaults:
  actions:
    comment:
      bot_account: Autobot

pull_request_rules:
  - name: comment with default
    conditions:
      - label=comment
    actions:
      comment:
        message: I ðŸ’™ Mergify
```

This configuration is equivalent to:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: comment with default
    conditions:
      - label=comment
    actions:
      comment:
        message: I ðŸ’™ Mergify
        bot_account: Autobot

```

In the example, the `bot_account` value is taken from the `defaults` section,
simplifying the `pull_request_rules` and ensuring consistent behavior across
different rules.

### Shared

You can store anything in the `shared` key. Its main purpose is to provide a
place to put redundant YAML anchors. See
[Sharing](sharing#sharing-configuration-sections).

### Extends

Mergify offers a feature to extend your configuration file by incorporating
settings from another repository, aiding in consistency and reducing
duplication. This is achieved by using the `extends` keyword at the top of your
configuration file and specifying the source repository. See [Extending
Configuration Files](sharing#extending-configuration-files).

{/* <OptionsTable name="Extend" /> */}

## OpenAPI Specification

For those interested in a more detailed and machine-readable description of the
Mergify configuration file format, an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)
specification is available. This specification can help you understand the
structure of the configuration file and can be used to generate client
libraries, server stubs, or API documentation.

OpenAPI specification for the Mergify configuration here</DownloadLink>.

## Validation and Troubleshooting

When working with Mergify's configuration file, it's essential to validate and
troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Ensuring that your configuration file
is error-free and well-structured can help prevent unexpected behavior and
maintain a smooth workflow.

### Validation

To validate your Mergify configuration file, you can use Mergify's built-in
validation tool. Whenever you push a change to the configuration file, Mergify
will automatically validate the configuration and report any errors or warnings
in the "Checks" tab of your pull request.

<Image src={configCheckScreenshot} alt="Mergify configuration check" />

If there are any issues with your configuration file, you will receive a
detailed description of the problem and guidance on how to fix it. Be sure to
address any errors or warnings to ensure optimal performance and avoid
potential issues.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues or unexpected behavior with your Mergify configuration
file, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Double-check the file name and location: ensure that your configuration file
   is correctly named (e.g., `.mergify.yml`) and is located in the right place.
   See [Configuration File Name](.#configuration-file-name) for details.

2. Verify the YAML syntax: confirm that your configuration file follows the
   proper YAML syntax, including correct indentation, spacing, and structure.

3. Review your rules and conditions: Make sure that your rules and conditions
   are correctly defined and accurately reflect your intended workflow.

4. Check for conflicting rules: examine your rules for any conflicts or
   overlapping conditions that could cause unintended behavior.

5. Consult Mergify's documentation: refer to Mergify's documentation for
   guidance on creating and managing your configuration file, as well as
   understanding the various features and options available to you.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can effectively identify and
resolve any issues with your Mergify configuration file, ensuring a smooth and
efficient automation process for your repository.

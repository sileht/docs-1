## Introduction

Mergify CLI is a powerful tool designed to simplify and automate the creation
and management of stacked pull requests on GitHub. Before diving into its
functionalities, let's grasp the concept of stacked pull requests and why they
matter.

## Understanding Stacked Pull Requests

In the world of development, a common scenario is having a `feature` branch
with multiple commits that are sequentially dependent on each other. For
instance, if you have a branch named `feature` with three commits: `A`, `B`,
and `C`, creating stacked pull requests manually on GitHub would require:

1. A branch `feature-A` for commit `A` with a pull request based on `main`.
2. A branch `feature-B` for commit `B` with a pull request based on `feature-A`.
3. A branch `feature-C` for commit `C` with a pull request based on `feature-B`.

While this method ensures structured and granular reviews, the native GitHub
approach has its challenges. If a modification is made to commit `A`, all
subsequent branches and their associated pull requests need manual updates — a
tedious and error-prone task.

## Mergify Stacked Pull Requests

With a mechanism similar to code review tools like
[Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/), Mergify CLI introduces a unique
identifier, named `Change-Id`, into the commit message. This identifier is
managed via a git commit-msg hook, ensuring systematic tracking of changes.
Here's a glimpse of the `Change-Id`:

```text
Change-Id: I7074fdf5e24e2d4de721936260e4b962532c9735
```

The tool utilizes the GitHub API to manage the pull requests, ensuring that
your local git repository remains pristine.

  For Mergify CLI to function effectively, branches must be in the `heads`
  namespace.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Streamlined Workflow:** This process ensures that developers don't have to
  tediously update each individual pull request manually. Everything is managed
  under the hood by Mergify CLI, from the commit level to the PR level.

- **Reduced Errors:** The automated nature of this approach minimizes the
  chances of human error—like missing a pull request update or misapplying a
  change.

- **Flexibility:** Developers maintain the freedom and flexibility of the Git
  interactive rebase, allowing for granular and precise changes to commits.

## Setting Up Mergify CLI

### Installation

Begin by installing the Mergify CLI using
[pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/):

```bash
pip install mergify_cli
```

### Configuration

To use Mergify CLI for creating stacked pull requests in your repository,
follow these steps:

1. Execute the following command to set up the commit-msg hook:

```bash
mergify stack --setup
```

2. Identify your trunk branch. This branch acts as the foundation for your
   stacked pull requests. You can configure it using:

```bash
git config --add mergify-cli.stack-trunk origin/branch-name
```

Alternatively, you can specify the trunk branch using the `--trunk` parameter.

3. For GitHub API access, Mergify CLI requires a GitHub OAuth token. If you
   have the [gh client](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated, Mergify CLI
   will seamlessly fetch the token. If not, create a [personal access
   token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
   with necessary permissions and set it as an environment variable
   (`GITHUB_TOKEN`). You can also provide it directly using the `--token`
   parameter.

## Creating Stacked Pull Requests

1. Spawn a branch and introduce your changes.

2. Commit the changes. If Mergify CLI is correctly configured, your commit
   message will automatically contain the `Change-Id`.

3. In case you committed before initializing Mergify CLI, use `git rebase
   <base-branch> -i` to reword commits and automatically embed the `Change-Id`.

4. To construct the stack, run:

```bash
mergify stack
```

Mergify CLI will manage the creation of individual pull requests for every
commit in your feature branch. This structured approach ensures smooth and
error-free management of changes and reviews.

## Updating Stacked Pull Requests

Inevitably, there will be times when you'll need to modify or refine your pull
requests—perhaps due to feedback from a code review or just a late realization.
Mergify CLI streamlines this process, ensuring your stacked pull requests are
always in sync with your latest changes.

1. **Stay in Your Feature Branch:** The beauty of stacked PRs lies in their
   granular structure. Always make sure you are working within the specific
   feature branch where the relevant commits reside.

2. **Modifying Commits:** To update or modify commits inside your branch:
   - Use the interactive rebase feature of Git:
     ```bash
     git rebase --interactive <base-branch>
     ```

   - Within the interactive rebase session, you can:
     - **pick** to retain a commit.
     - **reword** to change a commit message.
     - **edit** to modify the content of a commit.
     - **squash** to combine the commit with the previous one.
     - **drop** to remove a commit entirely.

   Make your desired changes and save. This action will reapply your commits on
   top of the base branch, incorporating the changes you've made.

3. **Pushing Updated Stacked PRs:** Once you've made all the necessary
   modifications to your branch and are satisfied with the changes, call the
   Mergify CLI with the `stack` command:
   ```bash
   mergify stack
   ```
   This command will push your modified commits and update the corresponding
   pull requests on GitHub. Mergify CLI intelligently keeps track of the
   relationships between your commits and the pull requests, ensuring
   everything remains synchronized.

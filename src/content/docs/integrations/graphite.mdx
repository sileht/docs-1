[Graphite](https://graphite.dev) is a modern code review tool designed for
fast-moving teams. It helps engineers write and review smaller pull requests
(PRs), stay unblocked, and ship faster. In this documentation, we explain
how to use Mergify with Graphite and highlight some important configurations.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository ready for Mergify usage.

- Graphite installed and configured for your project. If you are not familiar
  with Graphite, we recommend following their [quick start
  guide](https://graphite.dev/docs/graphite-quick-start).

In the following step we will use a sample stack with our "trunk branch" named
`main` and three branches A, B and C with their corresponding pull requests

```text
o C
│
o B
│
o A
│
o main
│
:
```

### Step 1: Configuring Your Repository

To ensure seamless integration between Mergify and Graphite, you need
to activate the **Automatically Delete Head Branches** setting on your
GitHub repository. Enabling this setting allows GitHub to automatically
delete the head branch upon pull request merge and change the base
branch of upstack pull requests to the branch in which the PR was merged.

For example, in our sample stack, when PR A is merged into `main`, enabling
this setting will delete branch A and change the base branch of PR B from
A to `main`.

To activate **Automatically delete head branches**, follow the steps outlined
in the [GitHub documentation: Managing the automatic deletion of branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).

### Step 2: Configuring Mergify

To ensure that Mergify only merges pull requests that are at the bottom of their
stack. In the [Mergify configuration file](/configuration/file-format),
you have to set a condition on the `base` attribute to be equal to the
name of your trunk branch (`main` in our sample stack).

Here is a sample of what your Mergify configuration file could look like for our
sample stack:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  - name: default
    queue_conditions:
      - base=main
```

This makes sure that if a user queues by mistake the pull request B while A
is not yet merged, the pull request B won't be queued.

### Step 3: Let the Magic Happen

Now that everything is set up, you can [queue your pull
request](/merge-queue/lifecycle). When Mergify is done merging pull request A
into `main`, GitHub will delete branch A and set `main` as the base branch for
pull request B. You can then queue the pull request B at its turn.

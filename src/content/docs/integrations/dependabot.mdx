[Dependabot](https://github.com/features/security) helps you keep your
dependencies up-to-date by automatically opening pull requests for outdated
dependencies. When combined with Mergify, you can automate parts of the process
even further, ensuring your projects stay current with minimal manual
intervention.

## Automating Dependabot Pull Request Merges

There are two primary ways to automate the merging of Dependabot PRs with
Mergify:

### 1. Direct Merge or Merge Queue

You can set up a pull request rule to automatically merge Dependabot PRs or
place them in the merge queue.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically merge Dependabot PRs
    conditions:
      - author = dependabot[bot]
    actions:
      merge:
      # Or use queue: to use the merge queue
```

### 2. PR Approval

If you have GitHub's branch protection set up to require approvals, you can use
Mergify to automatically approve Dependabot PRs.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically approve Dependabot PRs
    conditions:
      - author = dependabot[bot]
    actions:
      review:
        type: APPROVE
```

## Filtering Dependabot PRs

Dependabot provides specific labels for the type of dependency update, such as
`dependabot-dependency-name`, `dependabot-dependency-type`, and
`dependabot-update-type`. You can use these labels in your Mergify rules to
filter which Dependabot PRs to auto-merge. For instance, you might only want to
auto-merge minor version bumps:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Auto merge minor version bumps
    conditions:
      - author = dependabot[bot]
      - dependabot-update-type = version-update:semver-minor
    actions:
      queue:
        method: merge
```

## Batching Dependency Updates

For projects where there are frequent updates to a large number of small
libraries, it's efficient to batch these updates together. Using Mergify's
merge queue feature, you can automatically batch and test these updates
together, reducing CI load and ensuring compatibility.

For example, you could set up a merge queue to batch those PRs 10 by 10:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  # If you have other queues defined, add this at the end so it is processed last
  - name: dep-update
    batch_size: 10
    # Wait for up to 30 minutes for the batch to fill up
    batch_max_wait_time: 30 min
    queue_conditions:
      - author = dependabot[bot]

pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically queue Dependabot PRs
    conditions:
      - author = dependabot[bot]
    actions:
      queue:
```

## Disable Dependabot's Automatic Rebase

By default, Dependabot will try to rebase its pull requests every time there's
a new commit to the main branch. In high-velocity projects with a lot of
update, this can lead to unnecessary CI runs. It's recommended to disable
Dependabot's automatic rebase feature and instead rely on Mergify to queue and
merge these updates efficiently.

To disable automatic rebasing in Dependabot, use the
[`rebase-strategy`](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#rebase-strategy)
settings and turn off automatic rebase.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    # Disable rebasing for npm pull requests
    rebase-strategy: "disabled"
```

With Mergify and Dependabot working together, you can ensure your project's
dependencies are always up-to-date with minimal effort, ensuring a smooth and
efficient update process.

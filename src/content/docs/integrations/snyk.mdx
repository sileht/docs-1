Dependency management is pivotal for maintaining a robust and secure project.
But with regular updates, security patches, and version changes, it can become
overwhelming. Snyk and Mergify combined, offer a powerful solution to
streamline this process.

[Snyk](https://snyk.io) is a developer-focused security platform. Apart from
its renowned vulnerability scanning capabilities, it offers automated pull
requests for dependency updates. Regularly, Snyk checks your project
dependencies, and upon identifying a newer version, opens a pull request on
your GitHub repository. This PR contains detailed information about the update,
allowing for a thorough review.

## Setting Up Automated Dependency Upgrades with Snyk

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Choose a GitHub repository.
   - Create a Mergify account and integrate it with your repository.
   - Create a Snyk account and link it to your GitHub repository.

2. **Configuring Snyk**
   - Sign-up/log-in to Snyk.

   - Go to `Projects` > `Add projects`, and import the desired GitHub
   repositories.

   <Image src={enableScreenshot} alt="Enable desired repositories on Snyk"/>
   - To enable automated dependency upgrades: `Settings` > `Integrations` >
   `GitHub`.

   - Scroll to `Automatic dependency upgrade PRs` and activate it.

3. **Mergify Configuration**
   - Log in to Mergify with your GitHub credentials.

   - Select the repositories you want Mergify to manage.

   - Define the merge policy using the Mergify [configuration
   file](/configuration/file-format) file in the repository root.

     ```yaml
     pull_request_rules:
       - name: Automatic merge Snyk PRs on Status Checks passing
         conditions:
           - author = snyk-bot
           - base = main
         actions:
           merge:
             method: merge
     ```

     This configuration ensures that Snyk PRs are automatically merged when
     they meet the defined conditions.

## Batching Dependency Updates

If you are using Mergify [merge queue](/merge-queue) in projects where there
are frequent updates to a large number of small libraries, it's efficient to
batch these updates together. Using Mergify's merge queue feature, you can
automatically batch and test these updates together, reducing CI load and
ensuring compatibility.

For example, you could set up a merge queue to batch those PRs 10 by 10:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  # If you have other queues defined, add this at the end so it is processed last
  - name: dep-update
    batch_size: 10
    # Wait for up to 30 minutes for the batch to fill up
    batch_max_wait_time: 30 min
    queue_conditions:
      - author = snyk-bot

pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically queue Snyk PRs
    conditions:
      - author = snyk-bot
    actions:
      queue:
```

## Tips for Efficient Dependency Upgrades

To avoid being overwhelmed with too many PRs, consider the following strategies
using Snyk:

1. **Limit Open Upgrade PRs**: Restrict the number of simultaneous Snyk upgrade
   PRs.

2. **Selective Package Upgrades**: Choose specific packages to exclude from
   automated updates.

3. **Scope of Changes**: Opt for automatic upgrades of only minor and patch
   versions to avoid potential breaking changes.

4. **Automatically Merge**: Merge the pull requests as soon as they are ready.

5. **Batch Merge**: Leverage [batches](#batching-dependency-updates) to save CI
   time when using Mergify's Merge Queue.

When integrated, Mergify and Snyk transform dependency management into a
seamless process. Developers no longer need to keep tabs on every update or
fear merging PRs that might break the CI. By leveraging these tools, projects
stay updated, secure, and efficient, letting teams focus on what they do best:
creating excellent software.

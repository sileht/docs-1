# GitHub Actions Integration with Mergify

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a CI/CD platform
provided by GitHub that helps you automate tasks within your software
development life cycle. Mergify can interact seamlessly with GitHub Actions by
evaluating the status checks that GitHub Actions reports to your repositories.
This integration paves the way for powerful automation workflows that respond
to the outcomes of your GitHub Actions runs.

## Prerequisites

Before leveraging Mergify's features with GitHub Actions, ensure the following:

1. You've set up GitHub Actions in your repository. If you're new to GitHub
   Actions, their [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
   provides comprehensive guides.

2. GitHub Actions is already configured to report job statuses to your pull
   requests.

3. The [Mergify GitHub App](/getting-started) is installed in your repository.

## Using GitHub Actions Status Checks in Mergify Configuration

To harness the full power of Mergify and GitHub Actions, you can utilize status
checks reported by GitHub Actions as conditions in your Mergify rules.

:::caution
  GitHub Actions works slightly differently. To match a status check when using
  GitHub Actions, only the job name is used (not the workflow name).
:::

<Image src={statusCheckExample} alt="Status check example" />

Based on the example above, to validate the listed jobs, use the following
configuration:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically merge when GitHub Actions jobs succeed
    conditions:
       - check-success=changelog_sync
       - check-success=actionlint
       - check-success=docker-onpremise
       - check-success=docker-saas
       - check-success=docker-label
       - check-success=add-linear-author-as-reviewer
    actions:
      merge:
        method: merge
```

## Triggering GitHub Actions Workflow via Mergify

With Mergify, it's also possible to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow directly.
This can be achieved by using the
[`github_actions`](/workflow/actions/github_actions) action in your Mergify
configuration.

## Further Configuration and Advanced Use Cases

The integration of GitHub Actions with Mergify offers extensive possibilities.
You can:

- Craft rules that depend on specific GitHub Actions job results.

- Merge pull requests only after certain workflows complete successfully.

- React to failures in GitHub Actions runs by adding comments, labels, or even
  requesting reviews.

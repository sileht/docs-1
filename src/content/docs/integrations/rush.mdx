[Rush](https://rushjs.io/) is a renowned open-source build orchestrator
facilitating the handling, building, and publishing of multiple packages within
a single Git monorepository (monorepo). Rush efficiently breaks up large
applications into manageable pieces, each with its lifecycle and build
processes. In a Rush-enabled monorepo, [Mergify](https://mergify.com/) enhances
the development workflow by automating merges, implementing project-specific
merge queues, and adapting workflows to each sub-project's unique requirements.

## Why Mergify with Rush?

Mergify’s merge queue comes furnished with exclusive features, especially
designed for managing high velocity, large-scale monorepo projects. These
features enable:

- Independent management of each sub-project;
- Uninterrupted and parallel development cycles for each sub-project;
- Adaptation to each project’s unique processes and CI checks.

[Partition rules](/merge-queue/partitions) are Mergify's solution to monorepo
management complexities. Each partition operates in parallel and encompasses
all the queues defined in the `queue_rules`. They function independently,
allowing multiple sub-projects to coexist, each running their merge cycles
without interference from the others.

## Integrating Rush Project Structure with Mergify

### Implementing Partition-Based Merge Queues

Once Rush has modularized your project, each sub-project or app can have its
Mergify merge queue, automated according to its specific needs, CI checks, and
development lifecycle.

#### Creating Partitions for Each Project

To implement this, we define `partitions` for each sub-project using
[`partition_rules`](/merge-queue/partitions/) in our Mergify configuration.
Each partition can then have its specific [`queue_rules`](/merge-queue/setup)
defining the merge conditions based on each sub-project’s requirements.

#### Example Configuration

Here’s a simplified example where Rush has split a project into `projectA`,
`projectB`, and `projectC`, and we create a partition and queue for each:

```yaml
partition_rules:
  - name: projectA
    conditions:
      - files~=^apps/projectA

  - name: projectB
    conditions:
      - files~=^apps/projectB

  - name: projectC
    conditions:
      - files~=^apps/projectC

queue_rules:
  - name: default
    merge_conditions:
      - and:
        - or:
          - partition-name!=projectA
          - check-success=ciA
        - or:
          - partition-name!=projectB
          - check-success=ciB
        - or:
          - partition-name!=projectC
          - check-success=ciC
```

In this configuration:

- Pull requests modifying files in `projectA` will be managed by the `projectA`
  partition. Same for other projects.

- If a pull request alters files in multiple projects, it will be processed in
  each corresponding partition independently.

## Conclusion

Merging Mergify's automation prowess with Rush’s monorepo management
capabilities leads to a streamlined, efficient, and organized development
workflow. It not only fosters parallel development but also ensures each
sub-project retains its unique development rhythm, making monorepo management a
breeze.

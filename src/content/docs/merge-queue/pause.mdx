Mergify's Merge Queue offers a feature known as "pausing" that grants users
increased control over the automation process during special circumstances.
Let's explore what pausing involves, its impacts, and its typical use cases.

## What Does Pausing Do?

When you pause the merge queues:

1. **Pause All Queues**: All active merge queues will be suspended, not just a
   specific one. This affects all queues in the project.

2. **Addition to the Queue Continues**: Even with paused merge queues, new pull
   requests can still join the queue. This ensures pull requests remain
   organized and ready for when operations resume.

3. **Stops Scheduling and Actions**: After pausing the merge queues, Mergify
   will not schedule new checks, update, or merge pull requests. Pull requests
   can enter the queue but won't be acted upon.

4. **Cancel Running Checks**: As soon as the queues are paused, Mergify cancels
   any running checks and waits for the queues to be resumed.

## How to Pause the Merge Queues

### From the Dashboard

Navigate to your [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com). There
you'll find an option to pause the merge queues. Clicking on this will suspend
all active queues.

### Using the API

You can also pause the merge queues programmatically using the [Mergify
API](/api-usage). For detailed steps on how to achieve this, refer to our API
documentation.

## Typical Use Cases

### CI Incidents

During a major incident with the Continuous Integration (CI) system, the pause
feature can be invaluable. If there's a likelihood that checks will fail and
consequently eject the pull request from the queue, it's beneficial to pause
the merge queues.

### Non-CI Incidents

If an incident is unrelated to the CI, like a production issue, but you wish to
halt merging while allowing checks to run, then the [freeze feature](freeze) is
a more suitable choice. "Freezing" simply halts merges, letting checks and
other actions proceed.

## Benefits of Using the Pause Feature

1. **Maintain Queue Integrity**: During CI failures or other disruptions,
   pausing ensures pull requests stay in the queue, preserving their order.

2. **Flexibility**: It provides an immediate response tool during unexpected
   complications, giving you control over the merge process.

3. **Reduce Noise**: Constantly failing checks during a CI incident can create
   unnecessary notifications. Pausing the queue mitigates this.

The pause feature of the Mergify merge queue offers users an enhanced layer of
control and adaptability during special situations. Familiarizing yourself with
when and how to pause your merge queues can optimize your workflow and reduce
disruptions.

# Monitoring the Merge Queue

The performance and health of your merge queue are essential for maintaining a
productive and efficient development cycle. Monitoring key metrics ensures that
you can respond promptly to any bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or potential
issues. 

Understanding your merge queue's performance is pivotal for maintaining a
robust and streamlined development cycle. Regular monitoring and prompt action
based on these metrics can ensure you achieve optimal throughput and latency.

Here's a guide to the most critical metrics to monitor and how to
interpret them.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **PRs Merged Per Day:** Monitor this metric to ensure your throughput
  remains stable. Track the number of pull requests merged each day. A
  consistent trend indicates a stable development environment. Sudden drops or
  spikes can indicate issues that need attention.

2. **CI Runtime:** Keep an eye on CI times to ensure efficiency and timely
   merges. Monitor the time your Continuous Integration (CI) tests take to run.
   A sudden increase in runtime can slow down your entire merge queue, delaying
   other PRs.

3. **Merge Outcome:** High success rates indicate a healthy development and
   review process. It's essential to ensure that most of the PRs entering the
   queue get successfully merged. If PRs are frequently removed or fail to
   merge for any reason, it may signal a need for process refinement or
   improvement to the CI.

4. **Queue Size:** A manageable queue size ensures that PRs don't stagnate. The
   number of PRs waiting in the queue should be manageable. If the queue grows
   significantly or continuously, it indicates a bottleneck or an inefficiency
   in the process or CI.

5. **Running Checks:** A balanced number of running checks ensures you're
   utilizing your resources efficiently. Monitor the number of running checks
   in your queue. If you're often at full capacity, it might be time to
   consider adding more speculative checks to increase throughput.

6. **Time Spent in the Queue:** Reducing idle time reduces overall latency for
   your PRs. Track how long PRs spend idle in the queue. Extended idle times
   increase overall latency and can delay the delivery of features or fixes.

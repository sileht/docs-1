If you rely on labels for some reason (e.g., triggering workflows) and would
like to have those copied on the draft PRs that Mergify creates, you can use
the
[mergify-merge-queue-labels-copier](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mergify-merge-queue-labels-copier)
GitHub Action to copy the labels from the original pull requests to the draft
PR.

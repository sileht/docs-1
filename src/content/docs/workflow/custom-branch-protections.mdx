[GitHub's branch
protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
is foundational, but its customization is somewhat limited.

For more advanced or specific scenarios, Mergify's Workflow Automation can step
in, enabling you to define nuanced conditions that cater to your project's
unique needs. This flexibility means you can design branch protection rules
that the native system simply can't handle.

## Why Mergify Over Native GitHub Branch Protection?

1. **Advanced Conditions**: Mergify supports a vast array of conditions, which
   means you can create extremely specific rules.

2. **No Conflicts**: Using Mergify avoids potential conflicts with features
   like the [Mergify Merge Queue](/merge-queue/).

3. **Streamlined Workflows**: Combine branch protections with other workflow
   actions for a holistic approach.

There are two common ways of writing custom branch protection settings using
Mergify:

- Integrate your custom branch protection rules directly into your [automatic
  merge](automerge) rules;

- Write custom checks that are posted by Mergify on pull requests like a CI
  would do. These custom checks can also be used as conditions in the automatic
  merge conditions.

## Advanced Protection Rules for Automatic Merge

### Less Approval for Bot Users

Suppose you trust Dependabot's PRs and feel a single review is sufficient, but
other PRs require more scrutiny.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatic merge
    conditions:
      - or:
        - "#approved-reviews-by >= 2"
        - and:
          - author = dependabot[bot]
          - "#approved-reviews-by>=1"
    actions:
      merge:
```

With this, Mergify will automatically trigger the merge of a pull request if
author is [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) and has one approval, or
if the PR has two approvals.

This is more flexible than GitHub protected branch which only offers a fixed
number of approvals for any pull request.

### Documentation PRs

You could auto-merge pull requests only modifying documentation.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Documentation PRs
    conditions:
      # At least one modified file in the docs/ directory
      - files ~= ^docs/
      # No other files are modified
      # (note the - prefix to negate the condition), meaning:
      # if not (any files matches something else than docs/)
      - -files ~= ^(?!docs/)
    actions:
      merge:
```

### Advanced Review Workflows

Set rules based on the PR's author, title, or reviewer. For instance, if an
engineering manager submits a PR for a "hotfix", one review is sufficient.

However, for other developers, an engineering manager's review or any review
for a fix/revert is necessary.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Rules to merge hotfix PR automatically
    conditions:
      - check-success = my favorite CI
      - label = hotfix
      - or:
          - and:
              - author = @eng-mgr
              - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
          - and:
              # If the PR author is a member of GitHub "devs" team, they need
              # one approval from a manager unless PR is a revert/fix.
              - author = @devs
              - or:
                  - approved-reviews-by = @eng-mgr
                  - and:
                      - title ~= ^(revert|fix)
                      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
    actions:
      merge:
```

This allows pull requests to be automatically merged with conditions that are
finer-grained than GitHub generic branch protections.

### Scheduling Merges

You can schedule merges to happen only during office hours. For urgent fixes,
bypass this restriction using the `hotfix` label.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Schedule Merges
    conditions:
      - check-success = my favorite CI
      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
      - or:
        - schedule = Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00[US/Pacific]
        - label = hotfix
    actions:
      merge:
```

## Leveraging Custom Checks

Mergify offers an action named [post check](/workflow/actions/post_check) which
allows to post custom checks. This allows to implement feedback to developers
like a CI system would do, allowing to enforce extra rules on pull requests
before merging.

### Enforcing Conventional Commits

You might want to enforce some guidelines as how to write pull request titles.
The following rules add such a check, making sure your team follows
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The check will be posted only on pull requests targeting the main branch. The
check's conclusion will be a success if the title contains a conventional
commit type, otherwise it will be a failure.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Conventional Commit
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      post_check:
        success_conditions:
          - "title ~= ^(fix|feat|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(?:\\(.+\\))?:"
        title: |
          {% if check_status == "success" %}
          Title follows Conventional Commit
          {% else %}
          Title does not follow Conventional Commit
          {% endif %}
        summary: |
          {% if check_status == "failure" %}
          Your pull request title must follow
          [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
          {% endif %}
```

The result of this check will be visible in GitHub user interface, near the
merge button.

<Image src={postCheckActions} alt="Mergify Post Check" />

Checks posted by Mergify using this action are usable for any other conditions.
Taking the, you could use the posted check as a condition to merge
automatically your pull request:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatic Merge
    conditions:
      - check-success = my favorite CI
      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
      - "check-success=Rule: Conventional Commit (post_check)"
    actions:
      merge:
```

### Advanced Review Workflow

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: PR Approval
    conditions:
      - base = main
    actions:
      post_check:
        success_condition:
          - or:
            # Regular approval is 2 reviews
            - "#approved-reviews-by >= 2"
            - and:
              # Conditions for hotfix PR
              - label = hotfix
              - and:
                # If author is an engineering manager, one approval is enough
                - author = @eng-mgr
                - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
              - and:
                # If the PR author is a member of GitHub "devs" team, they need
                # one approval from a manager unless PR is a revert/fix.
                - author = @devs
                - or:
                  - approved-reviews-by = @eng-mgr
                  - and:
                      - title ~= ^(revert|fix)
                      - "#approved-reviews-by >= 1"
          # You can default to neutral rather than failure if the rule does not succeed
          # (Note that if you're using this with GitHub branch protections,
          # neutral is considered as passing and won't prevent merging.)
          # neutral_condition: []
        title: PR Approval
        summary: |
          {% if check_status == "success" %}
          This PR has been approved.
          {% else %}
          This PR has not been approved yet.
          {% endif %}
```

This example defines a complex workflow for approval, based on different
criteria. A pull request can be deemed approved when, either:
- it received 2 approvals;

- it has the label "hotfix", the author is part of the `eng-mgr` team and it
  has been approved by somebody else;

- it has the label "hotfix", the author is part of the `devs` team and it has
  been approved by a member of the `eng-mgr` team;

- it has the label "hotfix", the author is part of the `devs` team and it has
  been approved by somebody else and it fixes an issue or reverts a commit.

If one of those scenarios is true, the check `Rule: PR Approval (post_check)`
will be `success`; otherwise it will be `failure`.

You can then use this check as a condition for further automation, such as
merging automatically a pull request:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic merge when PR Approval matches
    conditions:
      - check-success = my-favorite-ci
      - "check-success = Rule: PR Approval (post_check)"
    actions:
      merge:
```

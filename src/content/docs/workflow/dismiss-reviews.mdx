title: Dismiss Reviews
description: Optimize your pull request workflow, tailoring review dismissal to specific scenarios and users.
---

Keeping your reviews up to date is essential to maintain a coherent and
reliable development workflow. Mergify offers a granular approach with the
[`dismiss_reviews`](/workflow/actions/dismiss_reviews) action.

1. **Conditional Triggers**: Only dismiss reviews when specific conditions on
   the pull request are met.

2. **Selective Removal**: Choose to remove only approvals, only reviews from
   particular users, or only changes requested.

3. **Targeted Dismissal**: Dismiss reviews only from users that are in the
   requested reviewers list.

4. **Event-driven**: Opt to have the action run when a PR is pushed again or
   keep it active continuously.

There are multiple scenarios where you can use this action to automatically
remove change requests or approvals.

## Re-Review on Push

Automatically dismiss reviews when new commits are pushed to a PR targeting the
main branch with a "re-review" label:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: dismiss reviews when new commits are pushed, if the label "re-review" is present
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - label=re-review
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
```

## Team-based Review Dismissal

Retain the approvals if the author is from a trusted team, even if they update
their code:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: remove outdated reviews for non trusted authors
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - author!=@mytrustedteam
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
```

## Specific User-based Review Dismissal

Dismiss reviews from specific users, which can be useful if you have a bot user
or a particular reviewer whose comments might not be relevant upon code
changes:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: remove reviews from the bot when the PR is updated
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
        approved:
          - mybotusername
        changes_requested:
          - mybotusername
```

## Dismiss Reviews When Request Review

When a user request a new review from a reviewer, asking for a review does not
dismiss the current review from the reviewer. You can do that using this
snippet:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: dismiss reviews when review is requested
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
        approved: from_requested_reviewers
        changes_requested: from_requested_reviewers
        when: always
        message: "Review dismissed due to new review request."
```

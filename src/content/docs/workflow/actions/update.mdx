title: Update
description: Update the pull request branch with its base branch.

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable'
import { Image } from "astro:assets"
import updateBranchScreenshot from "../../../images/workflow/actions/update/update-branch.png"

The `update` action instructs Mergify to update the pull request branch with
its base branch.

<Image src={updateBranchScreenshot} alt="Mergify Branch Update" />

When this action is added to a rule, Mergify will update the pull request
branch with the latest changes from its base branch, if necessary. This is done
by merging the base branch into the pull request branch or by rebasing the pull
request branch onto the base branch, based on your preference.

:::note
  You do not need to use this action if you use the [merge
  queue](/merge-queue). The merge queue automatically update the pull requests
  it processes as necessary, making sure they are tested with up-to-date code
  before being merged.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action='update' />

## Examples

### Update When Behind

You can ask Mergify to update your pull requests when they are a few commits
behind their base branch, for example:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic update of pull requests where more 5 commits behind
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - "#commits-behind>5"
    actions:
      update:
```

### Linear History

As GitHub supports linear history in pull request settings, it is very handy to
use a rule to keep your pull requests up-to-date. As you do not want to trigger
your CI too often by always re-running it on every pull request — especially
when there is still work in progress — you can limit this action to labeled
pull requests.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic update for PR marked as “keep-up-to-date“
    conditions:
      - -draft # filter-out draft PRs
      - label="keep-up-to-date"
    actions:
      update:
```

When a pull request is not a draft, and has the label `keep-up-to-date`, it
will be automatically updated with its base branch.

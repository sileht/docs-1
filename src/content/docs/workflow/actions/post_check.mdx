title: Post Check
description: Create a check-run on a pull request.

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable';
import Button from '../../../../components/Button.astro';

The `post_check` action allows Mergify to create a check-run on a pull request.
This can be useful in situations where you want to add a custom check to the
status of a pull request based on Mergify's evaluation.

:::note
  Checks posted by Mergify using this action are usable as any other condition.
  See the [example below](post_check#enforcing-conventional-commits).
:::

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="post_check" />

As the `title` and `summary` are
[templates](/configuration/data-types#template), you can benefit from any [pull
request attributes](/configuration/conditions#attributes-list), e.g. `{{author}}`,
and also these additional variables:

- `{{ check_rule_name }}` the name of the rule that triggered this action;

- `{{ check_succeed }}` is `true` if all the conditions match, `false`
  otherwise;

- `{{ check_conditions }}` the list of all conditions with a checkbox marked if
  the condition matches.

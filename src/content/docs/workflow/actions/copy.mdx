title: Copy
description: Copy a pull request to another branch.

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable';

The `copy` action enables you to automatically create a copy of a pull request.
When the conditions you specify are met, Mergify will create a new pull request
to merge the changes into the specified base branch.

:::note
  The `copy` action is equivalent to the [`backport`](backport) action. The
  only difference is that the `backport` action will only copy the original
  pull request once it is merged.
:::

Note that in case of a conflict during the copy, Mergify will create a pull
request with the conflict; you will have to resolve it manually. You can change
this behaviour using the `ignore_conflicts` option.

:::caution
  Please make sure the branches specified in the copy action exist and you have
  the necessary access permissions. If the branch does not exist or you don't
  have the required permissions, the action will fail.
:::

## Parameters

The `copy` action takes a list of branches to which the changes from the pull
request will be copied. The branch names should be specified as strings.

<ActionOptionsTable action="copy" />

As the title and body are templates, you can leverage any pull request
attributes to use as content, e.g., `{{author}}`. You can also use this
additional variable:

- `{{ destination_branch }}`: the name of the destination branch.

- `{{ cherry_pick_error }}`: the cherry pick error message if any (only
    available in body).

## Examples

### Using Labels to Copy

Below is an example of how to use the `copy` action:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: copy patches to the prod branch
    conditions:
      - label=copy-to-prod
    actions:
      copy:
        branches:
          - prod
```

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable'

The `review` action provides you with an automated way to review pull requests.
This can be particularly useful in situations where you want to automatically
approve pull requests that meet certain criteria, or to request changes on a
pull request when a particular check fails. By automating this process, you can
increase the efficiency of your workflow and ensure consistency in the way pull
requests are reviewed in your repository.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action='review'/>

## Examples

### Approve a pull request when all checks have passed

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic approval
    conditions:
      - check-success=myfirstCIname
      - check-success=mysecondCIname
    actions:
      review:
        type: APPROVE
```

In this example, Mergify will automatically approve any pull request once all
checks have passed successfully.

### Approve Dependabot Pull Requests

You can use Mergify to review a pull request on your behalf. This can be handy
if you require a minimum number of review to be present on a pull request
(e.g., due to [branch
protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches))
but want to automate some merge.

[Dependabot](https://github.com/features/security) is the bot behind GitHub
automatic security update. It sends automatic updates for your project's
dependencies, making sure they are secure. You can automate the approval of
pull request created by `dependabot` with a rule such as:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic approval for Dependabot pull requests
    conditions:
      - author=dependabot[bot]
    actions:
      review:
        type: APPROVE
        message: Automatically approving dependabot
```

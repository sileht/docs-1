import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable'

The `squash` action instructs Mergify to squash all commits from a pull request
into one.

When you add this action to a rule, Mergify will squash all the commits from
the pull request into one commit, making the history of your project cleaner
and easier to read.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action='squash'/>

## Examples

### Squash on Label

In this example, whenever there's a label `to-squash` added, any new commits
pushed to the branch will be squashed into a single commit:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: automatic squash of pull requests
    conditions:
      - label=to-squash
    actions:
      squash:
```

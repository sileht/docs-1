import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable';

The `delete_head_branch` action allows Mergify to automatically delete the head
branch of a pull request once it has been merged. This can be useful for
maintaining a clean repository and reducing clutter from unused branches.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="delete_head_branch" />

## Examples

Here is an example of how the `delete_head_branch` action can be used in your
workflow:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: delete head branch after merge if the label "cleanup" is present
    conditions:
      - merged
      - "label=cleanup"
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
```

In this example, Mergify will automatically delete the head branch of a pull
request once it has been merged, but only if the pull request has been labeled
with "cleanup".

The `delete_head_branch` action is a simple yet powerful tool that can help
maintain the cleanliness and organization of your repository.

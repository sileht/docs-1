## Examples

### Converting a Pull Request to a Draft on Check Failure

If any of your continuous integration checks fail, it might be worth converting
the pull request to a draft automatically since it's likely that it's not ready
for review.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: convert to draft
    conditions:
      - "#check-failure>0"
    actions:
      edit:
        draft: true
```

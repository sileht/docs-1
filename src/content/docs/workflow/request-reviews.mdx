Mergify's [`request_reviews`](/workflow/actions/request_reviews) action
provides an enhanced mechanism to automate and personalize your review process,
taking it several notches above GitHub's conventional review assignment. By
harnessing the versatility of pull request rules and conditions, you can define
intricate workflows tailored to your team's needs. Let's explore how to utilize
the action for various scenarios.

Below is a list of examples of what you could achieve with pull request rules
and the `request_reviews` action.

## Basic Assignment

Automatically request specific users or teams to review a pull request when
it's labeled with `review`. The rule checks for a pull request labeled `review`
and then requests reviews from `user1`, `user2`, and `team1`.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: request review from users and team when pull request is labeled with `review`
    conditions:
      - label=review
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - user1
          - user2
        teams:
          - team1
```

## Flexible Reviewers Assignment

Dynamic reviewer assignments based on the content and context of pull requests.

### File Type Based Review

Assign a Python expert to review changes in Python files.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask jd to review changes on python files
    conditions:
      - files~=\.py$
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - jd
```

### Label Based Review

For security-focused pull requests, you might want specialized teams to review.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask the security teams to review security labeled PR
    conditions:
      - label=security
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - "@myorg/security-dev"
          - "@myorg/security-ops"
```

## Random Review Assignment

Evenly distribute the review workload among team members.

This rule assigns two random users from a list of four to review pull requests
labeled as `review`.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: randomly ask two members for review
    conditions:
      - label=review
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - jd
          - sileht
          - CamClrt
          - GuillaumeOj
        random_count: 2
```

## Hierarchical Review System

Define a hierarchy in the review process, with junior team members reviewing
first. If changes affect critical components, senior members step in.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: junior review for all PRs
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - junior1
          - junior2

  - name: senior review for critical components
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - files~=^critical/
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - seniorDev
```

## Expertise-based Review Assignment

Ensure domain experts review relevant changes. If a PR modifies
database-related files, request a review from the database expert.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: database expert review for database-related changes
    conditions:
      - files~=^database/
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - dbExpert
```

## Load Balancing Review Assignments

Distribute reviews more fairly, ensuring certain team members aren't
overwhelmed.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: balanced review assignment
    conditions:
      - label=review
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          jd: 2
          sileht: 3
          CamClrt: 1
          GuillaumeOj: 1
        random_count: 2
```

## Cross-Team Review

Facilitate cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing. When core components
are changed, it's beneficial to get insights from another team.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: cross-team review for core changes
    conditions:
      - files~=^core/
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - "@anotherTeam"
```

{/* This is a great idea but we don't have pushed-at exposed yet

## Escalation of Review

Ensure stagnant PRs get the attention they need by escalating them to senior
team members.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: escalate review after 48 hours of inactivity
    conditions:
      - pushed-at>2 days
      - "#review-requested=0"
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - seniorReviewer
```

*/}

## On-Demand Review Request

Allow authors to trigger specific domain reviews by adding labels.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: on-demand database expert review
    conditions:
      - label=request-db-review
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - dbExperts
```

## Mentorship Review Process

Pull requests from new developers are first reviewed by mentors to ensure
guidance.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: mentor review for new dev
    conditions:
      - author=newdev
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - mentorUser
```

## Collaborative Review Process

When critical files are modified, request multiple teams to collaboratively
review the changes.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: multi-team review for critical changes
    conditions:
      - files~=^critical/
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - "@teamA"
          - "@teamB"
```

## Time-Sensitive Review

PRs marked as urgent get reviewed by a dedicated quick response team.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: urgent review request
    conditions:
      - label=urgent
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - "@quickResponseTeam"
```

With these comprehensive use cases, you're well-equipped to optimize and
customize your review workflows using Mergify's `request_reviews` action. Adapt
and mix these scenarios to perfectly fit your team's unique requirements.

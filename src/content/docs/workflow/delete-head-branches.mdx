title: Delete Head Branches
description: How to automatically delete head branches.
---

While GitHub offers settings for automatic deletion of merged branches, its
approach is often a blunt instrument, indiscriminately deleting any merged
branch. Mergify’s `delete_head_branch` action brings nuance to this process,
allowing repository maintainers to craft conditions under which branches should
be deleted after their pull requests are merged. By utilizing Mergify's
intricate [pull request rules and conditions](/workflow), users can design
custom branch cleanup strategies that cater to their specific workflow
requirements.

[GitHub's automatic branch deletion
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches)
provides the basic settings, but for those who require a more nuanced approach,
Mergify's `delete_head_branch` is the ideal tool.

**GitHub's Default Deletion:** As soon as a pull request branch is merged,
GitHub will automatically delete it, given the repository setting is enabled.
This doesn’t account for scenarios where you might want to retain the branch
for some time or under specific conditions.

**Mergify’s Conditional Deletion:** Using Mergify, one can establish specific
conditions under which a branch should be deleted post-merge. This can be based
on labels, types of files changed, the nature of the pull request, and more.

Here are a few example workflows that showcase the flexibility and power of
Mergify’s `delete_head_branch` action:

## Cleanup On-Demand

Only delete merged branches when the pull request is labeled with "cleanup".

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: delete head branch after merge if the label "cleanup" is present
    conditions:
      - merged
      - label = cleanup
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
```

## Prevent Deletion for Dependent Branches

Avoid deleting branches that other pull requests depend on, ensuring dependent
work isn't inadvertently closed.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: delete head branch after merge but not if other PRs depend on it
    conditions:
      - merged
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
        force: false
```

## Aggressive Cleanup

In scenarios where you are certain about deleting branches, even if other pull
requests depend on them:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: always delete head branch after merge
    conditions:
      - merged
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
        force: true
```

## Conditional Cleanup Based on File Type

For instance, if documentation-related branches (those that only modify `.md`
files) need to be deleted immediately post-merge:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: delete doc-related branches post-merge
    conditions:
      - merged
      - "files~=\.md$"
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
```

## Time-based Cleanup

Suppose you want branches to remain for a day post-merge for any potential
discussions and then get deleted:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: delete branches 24 hours post-merge
    conditions:
      - merged-at < 1 day ago
    actions:
      delete_head_branch:
```

The `delete_head_branch` action is an example of how Mergify offers detailed
control over Git workflows, moving beyond the default settings of platforms
like GitHub. By understanding the various use-cases and implementing them in
your repository, you can maintain a cleaner, more organized codebase, and
ensure that old branches don't clutter your project as it grows.

Remember, the key is in understanding your project's requirements and
leveraging tools like Mergify to tailor workflows that cater specifically to
those needs.

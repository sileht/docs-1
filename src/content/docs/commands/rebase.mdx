The `rebase` command provides users with an instant method to instruct Mergify
to rebase a pull request against its base branch. It's a handy way to ensure
that the pull request is updated with the latest changes from the base branch
without manually triggering a rebase.

By leveraging the `rebase` command, developers can keep their pull requests
up-to-date and maintain a clean commit history, enhancing the clarity and
quality of the project's development.

import RebaseAdvantage from './_rebase_advantages.mdx';

<RebaseAdvantage />

## Syntax

To make use of the `rebase` command, simply comment on the desired pull
request:

```text
@mergifyio rebase
```

<Image src={rebaseScreenshot} alt="Posting '@mergifyio rebase' in GitHub interface"/>

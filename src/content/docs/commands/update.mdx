title: Mergify Update Command
description: Update a pull request by merging its base branch into it.
---

The `update` command is a powerful tool in Mergify's toolkit, designed to
simplify the process of keeping pull requests current with their base branch.
For teams working in rapidly evolving codebases where the main or base branch
sees frequent changes, it's not uncommon for pull requests to become outdated.

Instead of manually merging the base branch Mergifyâ€™s `update` command takes
care of this seamlessly.

## Syntax

```text
@Mergifyio update
```

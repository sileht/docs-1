Mergify commands can be a powerful tool to control and manage pull requests.
However, in some scenarios, you might want to restrict who can use these
commands to ensure they're executed only by authorized individuals. The command
restrictions feature allows you to define a set of users or teams who are
permitted to use specific Mergify commands.

## How Restrictions Work

With command restrictions, you can leverage
[conditions](/configuration/conditions) to define the valid context that are
authorized to run a specific command. This could be a list of allowed users or
teams, or even attributes related to the pull request itself.

The restrictions are configured with the top-level key `commands_restrictions`
which can specify restrictions for each commands.

### Examples

To limit backport commands for pull requests coming from the `main` branch:

```yaml
commands_restrictions:
  backport:
    conditions:
      - base=main
```

To limit backport commands usage to a specific team (or user):

```yaml
commands_restrictions:
  backport:
    conditions:
      - sender=@team
```

To limit backport commands for users with a specific permission on the
repository.

```yaml
commands_restrictions:
  backport:
    conditions:
      - sender-permission>=write
```

## Default Restrictions

<RootOptionsTable name="commands_restrictions" />

### Command Restriction Format

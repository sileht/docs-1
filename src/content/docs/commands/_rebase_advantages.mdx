The `rebase` command provided by Mergify has several advantages over the native
GitHub rebase feature:

- Rebases are done using the
  [`--autosquash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---autosquash)
  option. This mean commits starting with `fixup!`, `squash!` or other commands
  will be honored.

- When the [`dismiss_reviews`](/workflow/actions/dismiss_reviews) action is
  being used, it will not reset the reviews if the rebase is executed by
  Mergify.

- It's always available, whatever the repository configuration might be.

- It can be [restricted](/commands/restrictions/) to certain users or teams.

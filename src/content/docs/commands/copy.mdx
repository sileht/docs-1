title: Mergify Copy Command
description: Copy a pull request to another branch.
---

The `copy` command is a convenient tool in Mergify's suite, allowing users to
replicate changes from a pull request to another branch within the same
repository. This is particularly useful for teams working with multiple
branches, such as feature branches, and wanting to propagate changes without
manually creating multiple pull requests.

Utilizing the `copy` command with Mergify can streamline your branching
strategy and development flow by quickly mirroring changes where needed within
the same repository.

After initiating the copy process, Mergify will provide feedback via comments.
If the copy is successful, a link to the new pull request will be provided. In
case of issues, Mergify will provide a concise description of the problem.

If Mergify encounters merge conflicts during the copying process, it will
create a pull request with the unresolved conflicts. These will need to be
resolved manually on GitHub.

The `copy` command is especially handy for:

- **Feature Propagation**: When a change made in one branch, such as a feature
  branch, needs to be mirrored in another branch, like a development or staging
  branch.

- **Hotfixes and Quick Patches**: When a quick fix made in one branch needs to
  be propagated to multiple other branches.

:::tip[Tips]

- Always review the new pull request created by the `copy` command before
  merging. This ensures that the copied changes align with the intent and
  context of the destination branch.

- Communicate with your team when using the `copy` command, especially if
  multiple developers are working on the same branches.

## Syntax

```text
@Mergifyio copy <target-branch> [<another-target-branch>] [â€¦]
```

## Parameters

- `<target-branch>`: The destination branch within the same repository.

## Example

Assume you have made changes in a pull request targeting the `feature-x` branch
and you want to copy these changes to the `development` branch:

```text
@Mergifyio copy development
```

Mergify will then try to create a new pull request in the `development` branch
with the changes from the current pull request.

title: Mergify Backport Command
description: Copy a pull request to another branch after merge.
---

The `backport` command is one of Mergify's most useful features, especially for
projects that maintain multiple branches simultaneously. This command automates
the process of creating a new pull request to apply changes from a merged pull
request onto another branch. Whether you're maintaining different versions of a
software or need to ensure that bug fixes are propagated to all active
branches, `backport` has got you covered.

With the `backport` command, managing changes across multiple branches becomes
a breeze. Say goodbye to the tedious manual cherry-picking and let Mergify
streamline your workflow.

Once the backport is initiated, Mergify will provide feedback directly in the
comments. If the backport is successful, you'll receive a link to the newly
created pull request. If there are issues, Mergify will provide a brief
description of the problem.

If Mergify encounters merge conflicts during the backport process, it will
create a pull request with the conflicts. You'll need to manually resolve these
conflicts within GitHub.

The `backport` command is especially handy for:

- **Version Maintenance**: Quickly propagate bug fixes to older, maintained
  versions of your software.

- **Feature Parity**: Ensure that features developed on a mainline branch are
  also available on other active branches.

:::note
This command is also [available as an action](/workflow/actions/backport).

:::tip[Tips]
  - Always review the generated backport pull request before merging, to ensure
    that the changes are compatible with the target branch.

  - If you anticipate a challenging backport due to major differences between
    branches, consider manually preparing the branch before invoking the
    `backport` command.

## Syntax

```text
@Mergifyio backport <target-branch> [<another-target-branch>] [â€¦]
```

## Parameters

- `<target-branch>`: The name of the branch to which the changes should be
  backported.

## Example

Suppose you have a pull request that was merged into `main`, but you also want
to apply these changes to a branch named `v2.0-stable`. You would use the
command as follows:

```text
@Mergifyio backport v2.0-stable
```

Upon executing this command, Mergify will attempt to automatically create a new
pull request with the changes onto the `v2.0-stable` branch as soon as the
original pull request is merged.

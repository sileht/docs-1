title: Mergify Refresh Command
description: Refresh Mergify status of a pull request.
---

The `refresh` command is used to manually trigger Mergify to reevaluate a pull
request's conditions. It's particularly useful if you've updated your Mergify
configuration and want to apply the new rules to existing pull requests without
waiting for a new event to naturally trigger the reevaluation.

## Syntax

To use the `refresh` command, comment on the pull request with:

```text
@mergifyio refresh
```

Mergify will then reevaluate the pull request based on your latest
configuration and rules.

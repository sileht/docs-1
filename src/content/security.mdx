## User Permissions

To perform any actions on Mergify, such as adding a pull request in a merge
queue or triggering a command, a person must have sufficient access to the
relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A
permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of
permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.

Mergify users inherit their roles directly from [GitHub
roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

That means that a user that has the `Read` role for a repository in GitHub will
also inherit this role in Mergify.

### Command Permissions

[Mergify commands](/commands) are [restricted by
default](/commands/restrictions/#default-restrictions) and have their own
mechanism that can be modified. See [Commands
Restrictions](/commands/restrictions/) for changing the default.

## Managing IP Addresses Allowed for the GitHub App

[GitHub allows to configure the list of IP adresses](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-a-github-app)
that a GitHub App is allowed to use to access GitHub.

Mergify services do not use a single static IP address. Therefore, you must
allow the AWS EC2 `us-east-1` IP addresses.

This list can be retrieved on [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html)
or via this command:

```bash
curl -s https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json -o- | jq -r '.prefixes[] | select(.region=="us-east-1" and .service=="EC2") | .ip_prefix'
```
